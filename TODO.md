# To do

* Docstrings, docs
* Datetime & pendulum matchers
* Write and use DiagnosingMatcher (similar to Java's [TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/javadoc/1.3/org/hamcrest/TypeSafeDiagnosingMatcher.html))
* Is it possible to reuse py.test's string (or object) comparison code? It produces lovely diffs when you have 2 strings to compare.
